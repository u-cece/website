            <h1>Programming stuff</h1>
            <h2>What/How I code:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>C/C++: I have a passion for coding in native languages, and something like C++ is obviously perfect for that. Something I also enjoy doing in C++ is template metaprogramming.</li>
                <li>Java: I am proficient in Java due to my experience in writing various kinds of Minecraft mods.</li>
                <li>Python: It's the first programming language I learned as a kid.</li>
                <li>Graphics programming: I really wanted to make games when I first started learning programming, and althought I didn't get anywhere in terms of that, I taught myself OpenGL and a lot of graphics programming related stuff in that process. I know plenty about 3D rendering in modern video games so feel free to ask me questions about it :)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What I've made in the past:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Machine learning: When I was 14, I learned some math and wrote an implementation of a fully connected neural network in C++ from scratch. It's not that much of an achievement looking back on it but I was proud of myself.</li>
                <li><a href="tracer_gallery.html">An unbiased path tracer</a> written in C++. I was obsessed with photorealistic rendering and this is what came out of it.</li>
                <li>Cheats for Minecraft, something I do for fun</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What I plan to learn:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Rust: All the cool kids use it nowadays.</li>
                <li>Haskell: I want to try out something different.</li>
                <li>Web dev: making web stuff is always cool + easy money</li>
                <li>Minecraft plugins: fun + easy money</li>
                <li>Cryptography and cybersecurity</li>
            </ul>
